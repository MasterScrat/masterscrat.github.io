![Florian Laurent](img/florian-laurent.jpg){:class="col one right"}

I am a computer scientist mostly interested in **reinforcement learning**. 

In the past I have worked as a full-stack web developer, using both the enterprise stack (Oracle/Hibernate/Spring) and the startup stack (React/Express/Firebase). I also have years of experience with Android native development, with both Java and Kotlin.

I am a computer scientist and entrepreneur, currently based in Switzerland (Vaud). I have a MSc from EPFL, did my Master Thesis at CERN building a dashboard system, then worked for 2 years in the banking industry. Since 2017 I work on my own projects and do freelance jobs on the side.

I have been working with all kind of companies, from early-stage startups to Top 15 Swiss companies. Through these various missions, my work has been deployed to hundreds of thousands of users.
