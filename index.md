**NyxAI (2022-current)** 
Building a Generative AI startup providing state of the art tooling for image generation.
Our product [dreamlook.ai](https://dreamlook.ai/) allows users to finetune Stable Diffusion text-to-image models in minutes.

**Cedille.ai (2021-2022)**
Trained and deployed the largest language model in French (6b), released under an open-source license (MIT), with a free and public playground.

**ML engineer at Coteries (2020-2022)**
I worked on ML projects, both for clients and internally, with a focus on NLP. Worked on the development, training and deployment of large custom language models (10b+ parameters) leveraging large GPU and TPU clusters.

**AIcrowd (2019-2021)**
Lead researcher of the Flatland project in 2020, which investigates the use of ML (specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning) for railway planning, in partnership with the national railway companies from Switzerland, Germany and France (SBB, Deutsche Bahn, SNCF).

Co-organizer of the associated Flatland 2020 NeurIPS Challenge. The challenge received >2k user submissions with results presented at NeurIPS 2020 and published in PMLR.

Workshop organizer: I presented highly-rated workshops about RL and NLP

**Full Stack/Machine Learning Freelance (2017-2019)**
I worked as a full-stack web developer, using both the enterprise stack (Oracle/Hibernate/Spring) and the startup stack (React/Express/Firebase). I also have experience with Android native development, with both Java and Kotlin.

Selected mandates over this period:
- Development of an Android application for the TV box of a national operator, deployed to >1M users (3 months full-time mandate, 2017)
- Setup a 128 GPUs Kubernetes cluster on AWS for the final evaluations of the NeurIPS 2018 Adversarial Vision Challenge competition (4 months 60% mandate, 2018)
- Conception of a Deep Reinforcement Learning course for a private EPFL-based company (12 months 60% mandate, 2019)
