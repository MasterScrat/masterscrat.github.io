Good news for everyone having fun with HTLM5 _canvas_ element: the prolific [Jacob Seidelin](https://github.com/jseidelin) (from Nihilogic) has put together a very nice cheat sheet:

> The information is pretty much just a copy of what is found in the WHATWG specs, just condensed and hopefully a bit easier to read. There are virtually no explanations, however, and no examples other than some graphics for compositing values and a few other things (the appearance of which is very much inspired by those found in Mozilla's examples). So, it's basically just a listing of the attributes and methods of the canvas element and the 2d drawing context.
